v1: replicate scAAVengr paper (hardcoded)
hardcode capsids (AAV2, AAV6, DJ, Anc80) and promoters (CAG, CMV, RHO)
use Arc Virtual Cell Atlas retina/brain data
outputs match paper: heatmaps, UMAPs, barcode counts
customer: Gene therapy researcher replicating scAAVengr tropism mapping fully in silico

v2: scientist input (custom data for science exeriment)
scientist uploads custom capsids, promoters, barcodes, and atlas
model integrates their data with Arc atlas
outputs reflect their specific experiment design
customer: gene therapy scientist testing custom AAV capsids, promoters, and cell atlases in silico

V3: model-guided design (consumer-facing, engineers still building behind the scenes, no longer science problem)
user provides only goal (cell type + protein to express)
system picks capsid/promoter candidates from library, predicts tropism, and simulates results
customer: genetic engineer specifying target cell type and protein—system designs and simulates optimal AAV delivery

V4: fully automated, hands-off
AI sets goal based on reader (other crucial piece of technology)
AI pulls relevant atlases, capsid candidates, promoters
runs design → simulation → validation loop
suggests or executes optimal wet-lab protocol automatically
customer (all consumers): Fully automated platform—AI selects, designs, and validates optimal AAV delivery from end to end
