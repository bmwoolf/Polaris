v1: replicate scAAVengr paper
hardcode capsids (AAV2, AAV6, DJ, Anc80) and promoters (CAG, CMV, RHO).
use Arc Virtual Cell Atlas retina/brain data.
outputs match paper: heatmaps, UMAPs, barcode counts.

v2: scientist input (custom data)
scientist uploads custom capsids, promoters, barcodes, and atlas.
model integrates their data with Arc atlas.
outputs reflect their specific experiment design.

V3: model-guided design (consumer-facing)
user provides only goal (cell type + protein to express).
system picks capsid/promoter candidates from library, predicts tropism, and simulates results.

V4: fully automated
AI sets goal based on reader (other crucial piece of technology)
AI pulls relevant atlases, capsid candidates, promoters
runs design → simulation → validation loop
suggests or executes optimal wet-lab protocol automatically
