Computational scAAVengr MVP that moves 99% of the wet lab work to being computational

Goal: simulate cell type x AAV serotype transduction rates from capsid sequence + promoter identity, entirely computationally

Key components:
1. cell model: model the type of cell in memory that we are going to use (animal species x organ x location in organ) 
2. capsid to tropism prediction: model that predicts transduction efficiency for each cell type given the capsid amino acid sequence and promoter type
3. synthetic scRNA-seq data generation (that may be a proxy for the cell type we are testing the AAV capsid in): create/obtain realistic scRNA-seq datasets with barcode integration, based on predicted transduction rates
4. reference genome building: add barcode sequences to an existing reference genome for read mapping
5. analysis pipeline: MLops that stitches it all together and performs read alignment, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and plotting to reproduce the same outputs as the wet-lab pipeline
