customer: scientist 

user needs to have:
- what cell types are relevant to their experiment (species, organ, region, sub-cell mechanism, protein they want to express)
- which AAV capsids they care about (viral protein sequence as an input)
- which promoters to test + tissue specificity they have


1. get cell data: pull retinal + brain single-cell atlases from Arc Virtual Cell Atlas (match the tissue that scAAVengr uses)
2. make cell embeddings: scVI encodes each cell type (species x organ x location) so the model knows what each scAAVengr cell cluster represents
3. get capsid data: use ESM-2/Evo2 on viral protein sequences for AAV2, AAV6, DJ, Anc80 (serotypes in scAAVengr)
4. encode promoters: simple vectors for CAG, CMV, RHO (same promoters scAAVengr tested)
5. predict tropism: combine cell, capsid, promoter vectors to predict % transduced per cell type (mimics scAAVengr's barcode counts)
6. simulate scRNA-seq: scDesign3/scVI to generate synthetic expression matrices with the predicted barcodes, matching scAAVengr's per-cell readouts
7. build reference: append 8nt AAV barcode sequences to genome for mapping
8. align + analyze: STARsolo -> Scanpy to recreate scAAVengr's UMAPs, clustering, + CellType x Serotype heatmaps
9. share: share via CellxGene
