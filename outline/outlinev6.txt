customer: gene therapy researcher who knows exactly what they want to test, but wants to approximate before running the wetlab experiments

the [customer] comes in with their:
- species (human, mouse, non-human primate) 
- organ (retina, brain)
- cell types (Muller glia, RGCs)
- target gene + protein to express
- capsid sequences (AAV_ FASTA)
- DNA sequence for promoters (CAG, CMV, RHO)

they upload the information via (change based on what they are used to):
- atlas.h5ad: single-cell reference (until we have full cells)
    > we fetch && download this for them with what they want
- promoters.yaml: array from the frontend drop down (["CAG", "CMV", "RHO"])
- capsid.fasta: protein sequnences of the AAV capsids they want to test
- barcodes.csv: if they want to force specific 8nt barcodes
